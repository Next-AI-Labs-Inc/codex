## Close-out Prompt

Run after implementation, before calling `task-complete`:

1. For each acceptance criterion, state PASS/FAIL/IN PROGRESS and evidence.
2. Confirm every constraint: upheld, adjusted, or violated (with rationale).
3. Summarize any remaining open questions and who owns resolution.
4. Declare approval readiness (`ready`, `needs review`, or `blocked`).
5. List follow-up tasks or deployment notes so reviewers know the next move.
