### Complexity Gate – decide the path before you spec

This step fires automatically during `spec capture` so you only consume the workflow that matches the UX impact you are about to create. Pick **one** tier and follow the linked instructions exactly—do not invent hybrids.

1. **SIMPLE (styling/copy/one-screen tweaks)**
   - Examples: “Change that color to black”, rename a label, adjust padding, add a log line.
   - Action: Stop the spec workflow now. Log the work via the standard Status Check template (alignment → implement → single UX validation paragraph). Capture before/after screenshots or admin steps, but skip `spec check/progress/review`.
2. **STRUCTURED (multi-step UX or data flow)**
   - Examples: new admin form, API changes, anything that affects state, routing, or multiple personas.
   - Action: Run the full spec journey: `spec check` before coding, `spec progress` after every UX-impacting chunk, `spec artifact` for docs, `spec review -a <feature>` once your review template is filled, then `spec close`.
3. **CRITICAL (compliance/payments/cross-system or high-risk work)**
   - Examples: SOC/HIPAA flows, subscription changes, logging pipelines, anything that impacts money, privacy, or cross-product navigation.
   - Action: Break the feature into nested GOAL → SUBGOAL → TASK blocks inside the spec. After every subgoal run `spec milestone`, then continue with the STRUCTURED path, but treat review evidence as a hard blocker before completion.

Rules:
- If you started SIMPLE but discover a larger UX change, rerun `spec capture` with STRUCTURED or CRITICAL before continuing.
- Never downgrade from STRUCTURED/CRITICAL to SIMPLE mid-task without user approval; doing so hides required review checkpoints.
- Document the level in `complexity_level` so downstream agents and the console can see why you either skipped or enforced the heavier stages.
