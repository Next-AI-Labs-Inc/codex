## Check Prompt

Use before coding or testing:

1. For each open question in the snapshot, decide:
   - **Resolved** – note the exact answer or link proving it.
   - **Deferred** – explain the condition needed before work continues.
   - **Escalate** – who needs to decide, and by when.
2. Record every decision with timestamp + initials in `clarifications/<feature>.log`.
3. If any question remains unresolved, document why work continues anyway.
4. If swarm tags exist, state whether the related swarm will run now or later.
