Milestone Completion Report

Whenever you reach a substantive milestone (anything verifiable in UX or admin experience), run this prompt before continuing. Minimum 10 sentences describing the new UX state.

Include:
1. Overarching intent (UX impact) translated into human terms.
2. Subgoal intent(s) nested under the main goal; show how they ladder up.
3. Tasks completed, expressed as UX changes (not code) with emoji for status.
4. Exact UX before vs. after—what users/admins/agents now experience.
5. Verification steps: visit → click → notice sequences so reviewers can validate.
6. Call out any new user stories introduced (explicit bullet list).
7. State which initial requirements/constraints you honored or deferred.
8. Remind reviewers of the stored user quote and prepend it in your report.
9. No fluff, no jargon; pure UX/intent language.
10. Do not wait for permission after sending—keep working.
