Before capture you must initialize swarm memory:
1) Open a terminal at the repo root.
2) Run `swarm` (no arguments) to load READ/WRITE instructions.
3) Scan for relevant memories.
Only after finishing those steps should you press Enter to continue with `bin/spec capture`. Document blockers in the spec, but do not stop work once they’re logged—keep moving through the workflow.
