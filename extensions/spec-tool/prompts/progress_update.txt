Progress Update (run after every UX-impacting sub-step)

Use this template immediately after you finish a slice of work so the Epic UI shows exactly how intent is being fulfilled. Minimum 10 sentences describing UX-now vs UX-before are required.

When you list tasks, concerns, or intent confirmations, prefix each line with a bracketed status label like `[actionable]`, `[done]`, or `[for review]` so the UI can display badges automatically.

1. Restate the overarching intent in UX terms.
2. Name the subgoal you just advanced and describe how it ladders up to the overarching intent.
3. List the completed sub-steps (emoji + UX phrasing). Do not use code-only jargon.
4. Explain the technical nuance and how it connects back to the UX promise.
5. Describe the UX now versus before in at least 10 sentences. Make it so an admin with no code context can understand the delta.
6. Provide exact validation instructions (“Go to http://..., click X, notice Y… if Y is true that proves requirement A because B wants to see C.”).
7. Explicitly call out which original requirements were honored or deferred.
8. If new user stories emerge, list them verbatim (“As an admin…” etc.).
9. Use emoji to show the status of each explicit intent confirmation line.
10. End with the copy/paste block emitted by this command so observers can drop it straight into the Epic UI.

If you shipped docs/runbooks, log them with `spec artifact <feature>` before sending this update so the UI can surface those links.
